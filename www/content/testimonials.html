Nothing is too much trouble. All at a very reasonable cost. We certainly would recommend Wellington House, for any start up or long established business. We look forward to being here for another ten years.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>The location of the building makes it quite accessible, without getting caught in town centre traffic.  A staffed reception area means clients are greeted on arrival, and clients love that they can park on-site for meetings.  Town centre is a few minutes’ walk offering ready access to a full range of services.  Flexible licence terms and a range of room sizes really suit growing businesses.</blockquote>
